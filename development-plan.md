Development Plan

1. Project Setup:
Create a new GitHub repository for your project.
Set up the necessary development environment, including Node.js and PostgreSQL.
Initialize the frontend and backend directories using the folder structure mentioned earlier.
Commit the initial project structure to the repository.

2. Frontend Development:
Set up the ReactJS project in the client directory.
Create reusable components for the user interface.
Implement the necessary pages for user registration, login, trip search, booking, and user dashboard.
Integrate the frontend with APIs for user authentication, trip data, and payment processing.
Style the frontend using CSS frameworks or custom stylesheets.
Test the frontend code to ensure proper functionality and responsiveness.
Commit and push the frontend code to the repository.

3. Backend Development:
Set up the Node.js project in the server directory.
Implement the necessary server routes for user authentication, trip management, payment processing, and communication with partners.
Create controllers and models for handling business logic and data manipulation.
Connect the backend with the PostgreSQL database using an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library like Sequelize.
Implement email integration using the SendGrid API for user notifications and partner communication.
Test the backend endpoints using tools like Postman or Insomnia.
Commit and push the backend code to the repository.

4. Database Setup and Migration:
Create a PostgreSQL database and configure the connection details in the backend's database configuration file.
Set up database migrations using a migration tool like Knex.js or Sequelize migrations.
Define database tables and relationships required for user profiles, bookings, trip information, and partner details.
Run the migrations to create the necessary tables in the database.
Seed the database with initial data if required.
Test the database connectivity and data retrieval.

5. Payment Gateway Integration:
Set up developer accounts with PayPal and Stripe.
Integrate the PayPal API and Stripe API into the backend for processing payments.
Implement the necessary endpoints and logic to handle payment requests and responses.
Test the payment integration with sandbox accounts and verify successful transactions.

6. Deployment and Hosting:
Set up an AWS account and configure necessary services like EC2, RDS, and S3.
Configure the server environment variables and deployment scripts.
Deploy the backend server to an AWS EC2 instance.
Set up and configure the frontend deployment using AWS S3 or a hosting service like Netlify or Vercel.
Configure the necessary DNS settings for the domain name (if applicable).
Test the deployed application in a production-like environment.

7. Testing and Bug Fixing:
Perform thorough testing of the entire application, including frontend interactions, backend APIs, database operations, and payment processing.
Identify and fix any bugs or issues encountered during testing.
Conduct cross-browser and cross-device testing to ensure compatibility.
Implement error handling and logging mechanisms to track and troubleshoot issues in production.

8. Documentation and Deployment:
Document the setup instructions, API documentation, and any other relevant information for future reference and collaboration.
Write a comprehensive README.md file explaining the project, installation steps, and usage instructions.
Ensure all sensitive information, such as API keys and database credentials, are properly secured.
Deploy the updated and tested code to the production environment.
Monitor the application in the production environment, checking for errors and performance issues.
